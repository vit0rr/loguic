This repository contains some [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems and their solutions. Each problem has a folder with the language, and the problem file is followed by the number of the problem and the name.

But I'll focus to solve problems in:
- Rust
- Golang
- TypeScript

If you want to run some leetcode, I recommend you to not open the main project folder. Instead, open the folder of the language you want to run, and then run the main file that contains the output of the problems.
